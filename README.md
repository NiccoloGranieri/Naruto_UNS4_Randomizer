# Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 Randomizer
A small piece of software used to add some casual fun to the Free Battle mode in: Naruto, Ultimate Ninja Storm 4.

Dowload the OSX App Bundle from Sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/naruto-uns4-randomizer/

## How to use the app

Open the app and choose the characters and team members that are displayed.

Once the characters have been chosen, and the Handicap has been set (handicap goes from -4 to +4, 0 handicap is a balanced match) start the battle. As soon as the battlefield is displayed, and you're ready to battle, press the black button with the white border. That button will unveil the personal rule each player will have to respect throughout the whole fight. Going against that rule is considered a loss. You unveil the personal rule only once the match has started in order not to influence the characters choice. (No Shuriken will inevitably make the player avoid characters like Temari).
